This project showcases my work as part of the **"Wee Extremes"** team during the **EVA (2023) Conference Data Challenge**. It is summarized in the peer-reviewed article, *“A wee exploration of techniques for risk assessments of extreme events”* (Extremes, 2024).

## Motivation & Objectives

Estimating risk measures for extreme events—such as high quantiles or joint exceedance probabilities—in environmental data is challenging due to:

- Non‑stationarity (covariate effects)  
- Sparse data in the tail  
- Multivariate dependence structure  
- Extrapolation to unobserved extreme levels  

The EVA challenge provided a structured testbed (four tasks: C1–C4) involving both univariate and multivariate extremes in a simulated “Utopia” environment. The data were designed to mimic real environmental settings while preserving controlled truth for evaluation.  

Our goal was to build a composite methodology combining multiple statistical tools to robustly estimate extreme quantiles, tail probabilities, and joint behavior under uncertainty.

## Methodological Approach

Key components of our approach include:

- **Non-Stationary Modeling**  
  Extended traditional Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) by incorporating covariate effects, primarily through **GAM** based **Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD)** parameterizations to model the conditional tail.

- **Tail Extrapolation**  
  Rigorously compared different methods (e.g., **GAM-GPD vs. Quantile Extrapolation**) in Task C1 to select the optimal approach for predicting unobserved extreme levels.

- **Dependence Structure**  
  Used **Copula frameworks** for multivariate tasks (C3, C4) to effectively model joint exceedance probabilities beyond the limitations of marginal modeling.

- **Uncertainty Quantification**  
  We used **Block Bootstrap methods** to assess and validate model uncertainty. Crucially, the Block Bootstrap allowed us to perform **model selection validation** by generating pseudodata that preserves dependence structure, enabling us to test model performance against **unobserved extreme data** (far-tail extrapolation).

- **Stability & Robustness**  
  Employed **Model Averaging** across bootstrap samples and **Dimensionality Reduction** techniques to mitigate overfitting and stabilize extreme quantile estimates.

## Key Findings & Insights 💡

Our results highlighted the critical impact of tail assumptions on risk estimates:

- **Validation is Key for Extrapolation**   
  Our use of the Block Bootstrap was essential for validating model choices, especially when extrapolating to extreme return levels beyond the observed data range.

- **Tail Behavior is Critical**   
  Methods assuming lighter tail behavior than reality tended to severely underestimate risk, particularly for extreme return levels.

- **Dependence is Decisive**  
  Errors in tail dependence modeling can severely bias joint exceedance probability estimates (Tasks C3, C4).

- **Stability Matters**  
  Model averaging and bootstrap techniques were crucial to stabilize extreme quantile estimates and provide reliable uncertainty bounds.

## Outcome & Publication

- The work produced a peer-reviewed article:  
  *“A wee exploration of techniques for risk assessments of extreme events”* (**Extremes, 2024**).
  
- We contributed methodology that blends EVA, copula theory, dimensionality reduction, and bootstrap averaging.
