I am a graduating Ph.D. researcher specializing in the intersection of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and Causal Inference, with a focus on applications in Climate Extremes and Environmental Statistics. 

I am currently exploring my next career steps and actively seeking Lectureship, research-intensive, or Postdoctoral positions (including competitive fellowships like EPSRC/Leverhulme). I welcome contact from supervisors or institutions interested in hosting my research. 

My full CV is attached for your review.
