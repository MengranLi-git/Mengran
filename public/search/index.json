As these events are becoming more frequent and intense, the need for robust statistical tools to underpin these assessments is more critical than ever.\nAttribution studies often rely on complex statistical models to characterize the behavior of rare events residing in the tail of the climate data distribution. The challenge is that climate extremes are inherently multivariate and high-dimensional. Therefore, the model choice is critical, as it must accurately capture the joint tail behaviour—the way these extreme variables occur together. Errors in modeling this tail dependence can lead to significant biases in attributing climate change\u0026rsquo;s influence.\nThis project employs a counterfactual causal inference framework, comparing the factual world (with human influence) against a counterfactual world (without human influence). Within this framework, we compare three distinct multivariate models designed to handle high-dimensional extreme data. Our objective is to estimate Attribution Ratios (ARs), which quantify the probability that human influence was necessary for the event\u0026rsquo;s occurrence.\nGoals Sensitivity Analysis: We aim to show precisely how the choice of tail model in EEA affects the resulting causal attribution conclusion.\nPractical Guidance: We will offer concrete, practical guidance for selecting and validating appropriate tail models in this context, thereby enhancing the scientific rigor and reliability of future attribution studies.\nMethodology: Comparing Three Multivariate Tail Models We employ a counterfactual causal inference framework, comparing three advanced multivariate models that represent different theoretical assumptions about extremal dependence.\nModel Core Concept \u0026amp; Assumption Key Feature Multivariate GPD (mGPD) A peaks-over-threshold model built on an exponential random vector. Assumes a rigid dependence structure (limited flexibility in how variables co-occur). Exponential Factor Copula (eFCM) Uses a shared exponential factor ($V$) added to a Gaussian process to induce spatial dependence. Provides flexible dependence via mixing, well-suited for regional extremes that decay with distance. Huser-Wadsworth (HW) Model A multiplicative model that bridges two theoretical regimes (asymptotic independence and dependence). A unified, data-driven model where parameter $\\delta$ lets the data decide the strength of the tail link. Key Research Focus: We measure the models\u0026rsquo; performance by estimating conditional dependence $\\mathbb{P}(U_2 \u0026gt; u \\mid U_1 \u0026gt; u)$ as $u \\to 1$ and observing how significant model discrepancies (misspecification) propagate to the final AR estimates.\nCore Findings from Simulation \u0026amp; Application A. Simulation Study: Impact of Model Misspecification Critical Result: Simulation Study 1 confirmed that misspecification of the extremal dependence structure leads to substantial bias in probability estimates ($\\hat{p}$). Accurate marginal distributions alone are insufficient. Performance: Study 2 showed that the eFCM consistently outperforms the mGPD in recovering the true tail probability, especially as the true underlying dependence strength increases. This validates the need for flexibility. B. Real Data Application: Multi-Region Attribution We applied the models to two distinct climate datasets: European winter precipitation maxima (CNRM model) and U.S. daily precipitation (ACCESS-CM2 model).\nModel Fit: The eFCM provided the best empirical fit for tail dependence in both regions, while the mGPD consistently showed overly strong, rigid dependence. Impact on ARs: The model choice strongly influences the spatial pattern of attribution: Rigid Tails (mGPD): Produced overly smooth maps and consistently overstated Attribution Ratios (ARs) across broad regions. Flexible Tails (eFCM/HW): Revealed realistic, regionally varying AR patterns, aligning better with physical and regional climate insights. Application Conclusion: Rigid tail assumptions severely bias attribution results. Flexible models are essential to reveal the true regional contrasts in the influence of climate change.\nConclusions and Guidance Key Conclusions Tail Dependence Matters: Attribution results depend critically on how joint extremes are modeled; misspecifying the tail structure can bias or reverse conclusions. Model Flexibility Improves Credibility: eFCM/HW fit tails well; mGPD overstates ARs. Choosing the right extremal dependence model is essential for credible EEA. Practical Guidance for Future EEA Studies Tip Rationale Prioritise Dependence Structure. Simulation results show dependence error is the dominant source of bias in probability estimation. Do Not Trust Margins Alone. Good marginal fit does not guarantee a realistic tail dependence structure. Prefer Robust Models. Choose models with built-in flexibility (like eFCM or HW) that yield more stable AR estimates and narrower uncertainty intervals. Choose Interpretability. Select models that produce scientifically defensible and usable AR patterns.

It is summarized in the peer-reviewed article, “A wee exploration of techniques for risk assessments of extreme events” (Extremes, 2024).\nMotivation \u0026amp; Objectives Estimating risk measures for extreme events—such as high quantiles or joint exceedance probabilities—in environmental data is challenging due to:\nNon‑stationarity (covariate effects) Sparse data in the tail Multivariate dependence structure Extrapolation to unobserved extreme levels The EVA challenge provided a structured testbed (four tasks: C1–C4) involving both univariate and multivariate extremes in a simulated “Utopia” environment. The data were designed to mimic real environmental settings while preserving controlled truth for evaluation.\nOur goal was to build a composite methodology combining multiple statistical tools to robustly estimate extreme quantiles, tail probabilities, and joint behavior under uncertainty.\nMethodological Approach Key components of our approach include:\nNon-Stationary Modeling\nExtended traditional Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) by incorporating covariate effects, primarily through GAM based Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) parameterizations to model the conditional tail.\nTail Extrapolation\nRigorously compared different methods (e.g., GAM-GPD vs. Quantile Extrapolation) in Task C1 to select the optimal approach for predicting unobserved extreme levels.\nDependence Structure\nUsed Copula frameworks for multivariate tasks (C3, C4) to effectively model joint exceedance probabilities beyond the limitations of marginal modeling.\nUncertainty Quantification\nWe used Block Bootstrap methods to assess and validate model uncertainty. Crucially, the Block Bootstrap allowed us to perform model selection validation by generating pseudodata that preserves dependence structure, enabling us to test model performance against unobserved extreme data (far-tail extrapolation).\nStability \u0026amp; Robustness\nEmployed Model Averaging across bootstrap samples and Dimensionality Reduction techniques to mitigate overfitting and stabilize extreme quantile estimates.\nKey Findings \u0026amp; Insights 💡 Our results highlighted the critical impact of tail assumptions on risk estimates:\nValidation is Key for Extrapolation\nOur use of the Block Bootstrap was essential for validating model choices, especially when extrapolating to extreme return levels beyond the observed data range.\nTail Behavior is Critical\nMethods assuming lighter tail behavior than reality tended to severely underestimate risk, particularly for extreme return levels.\nDependence is Decisive\nErrors in tail dependence modeling can severely bias joint exceedance probability estimates (Tasks C3, C4).\nStability Matters\nModel averaging and bootstrap techniques were crucial to stabilize extreme quantile estimates and provide reliable uncertainty bounds.\nOutcome \u0026amp; Publication The work produced a peer-reviewed article:\n“A wee exploration of techniques for risk assessments of extreme events” (Extremes, 2024).\nWe contributed methodology that blends EVA, copula theory, dimensionality reduction, and bootstrap averaging.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/posts/eva2023/","series":[],"tags":[],"title":"Wee Extremes: EVA 2023 Data Challenge"}]
